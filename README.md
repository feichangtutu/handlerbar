we would create a helper named list to generate our HTML list. 
The helper receives the people as its first parameter, 
and an options hash as its second parameter. 
The options hash contains a property named fn,
 which you can invoke with a context just as you would invoke a normal Handlebars template.
 
######Block expressions allow you to define *helpers* 
that will invoke a section of your template with a different context than the current.
*These block helpers* are identified by a # preceeding the helper name and require a matching closing mustache, /, of the same name.
